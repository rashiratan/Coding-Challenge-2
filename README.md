# Coding-Challenge-2
This is a repository for Coding-Challenge-2 for the ISM3232 Class where we will create a bill splitting app.
In this challenge, we will create an app that is able to split customer's bills to calculate the bill and tip that they owe. It is also able to tell them the total amount that they should be paying. 

It is important to note that the basis of the app lies on the logic that the tip is usually 15% of the bill amount if it is between $50 and $300. For all other bill amounts, the tip is 20%.
